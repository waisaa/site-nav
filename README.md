## Key points

- **Open source and free to use**. Embrace a future where creativity knows no boundaries with our open-source solution. All features are free to use and will never be charged in any form or content.
- **Self-hosting with Docker in just seconds**. Enjoy the flexibility, scalability, and ease of setup that Docker provides, allowing you to have full control over your data and privacy.
- **Customize your preferences**. With our intuitive customizing features, you can easily personalize your favorite themes and wallpapers.
- **Usage with embedded MySQL.** I would recommend using a Docker `volume` or `bind` mount for persistent data like shown in the examples below.

## Quick installation

#### Prerequisites
- Git
- Docker
- Docker Compose

#### Deploy with Docker Compose in seconds
- Get the source code
```sh
git clone https://github.com/waisaa/web-nav.git
```
- Enter the directory
```sh
cd web-nav/
```
- Build images of all services and start all services in detached mode
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

#### Remove installation
- Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes, and images associated with the Docker Compose.
```sh
docker-compose down
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command is only applicable for Unix/Linux systems.
>
> The `./mysql/data` directory should be used as the data directory on your local machine, while `/var/lib/mysql` is the directory of the volume in Docker and should not be modified.
